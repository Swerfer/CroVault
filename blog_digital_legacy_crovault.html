    <h1>How to Prepare Your Digital Legacy With CroVault</h1>
    <h2>What Happens to Your Data After You're Gone?</h2>
    <p>In our digital lives, we collect everything from bank logins and crypto wallets to personal notes and family documents. But what happens to all that data when we’re no longer around?</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the answer for most people is: <strong>no one knows how to access it</strong>.</p>

    <h2>The Problem: Lost Data, Frozen Assets, Frustrated Families</h2>
    <p>Without a clear plan, your family might be locked out of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email and social media accounts</li>
      <li>Cryptocurrency wallets and DeFi platforms</li>
      <li>Notes and password vaults</li>
      <li>Two-factor authentication apps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even worse, many services require legal paperwork and court orders to access anything—if they allow it at all.</p>

    <h2>Enter CroVault: A Secure Digital Vault for Inheritance</h2>
    <p>CroVault offers a privacy-first, blockchain-secured solution to digital inheritance. Here’s how it works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You create a vault tied to your crypto wallet.</li>
      <li>Store encrypted versions of your most important digital credentials and notes.</li>
      <li>Set up optional guidance for loved ones to unlock it, like password hints or estate documents.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unlike traditional services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No servers.</strong> The data lives on-chain.</li>
      <li><strong>No bureaucracy.</strong> You define access rules.</li>
      <li><strong>No recovery requests.</strong> Only your trusted recipients can unlock it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Set It Up</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Connect your wallet on <a href="https://crovault.com">CroVault.com</a>.</li>
      <li>Choose a strong password.</li>
      <li>Add notes like “Crypto instructions” or “Where to find my master password.”</li>
      <li>Inform a trusted person of how to access the vault when the time is right.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Your loved ones will already be dealing with grief. Don’t make them guess your passwords too.</p>
    <p>With CroVault, you leave behind clarity—not chaos.</p>
