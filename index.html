            <summary>How safe is my data in the vault?</summary>
            <p>
              Your vault data:
              <ul>
                <li>Is encrypted client-side, in the browser</li>
                <li>Uses AES-GCM with a key derived from:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>A password you choose (sessionPassword)</li>
                  <li>A signed wallet message (your real crypto wallet)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>That’s very strong and follows best practices:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>PBKDF2 key derivation with high iteration count</li>
                  <li>Salted + randomized IVs</li>
                  <li>Combined symmetric & asymmetric identity via wallet signature</li>
                </ul>
                <li>✅ Your data is encrypted before storing on the blockchain</li>
                <li>✅ The server never sees unencrypted data</li>
                <li>✅ The signed message ties it to your wallet</li>
                <li>✅ No one else can decrypt it, even if they have the ciphertext</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Always remember: <strong>your password and wallet are the key to your vault</strong>. If you lose even one of them, you lose access to your data.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How is it safe to store privacy data on a blockchain?</summary>
            <p>
              The data is encrypted before being stored on the blockchain. 
              Only you can decrypt it using your password and wallet signature. 
              Even if someone finds the data on the blockchain, they won't be able to read it without your password and wallet signature.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Note: </strong>People store 100s of thousands of dollars worth of crypto on the blockchain.
              The blockchain is a very secure place to store data, because you need a private key to access it. 
              Your privacy data is encrypted with a very strong encryption algorithm (AES-GCM) with a key derived from your password and wallet signature.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What blockchain is used?</summary>
            <p>
              CroVault uses the <strong>Cronos</strong> blockchain, which is an EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain. 
              It is a very secure and fast blockchain with low fees. 
              The data is stored in your own personal vault contract on the blockchain, which is created when you create a vault.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What is the difference between a vault and a wallet?</summary>
            <p>
              A vault is a blockchain-secured password manager where you can store credentials, encrypted notes, seed phrases, and private information. 
              A wallet holds your crypto. CroVault separates the two to give you full control over sensitive data beyond financial assets. 
              The vault allows you to store credentials, notes, and wallet addresses securely, while the wallet is used for transactions and managing your crypto assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The vault is designed to keep your sensitive information safe, while the wallet is designed to manage your crypto assets.
          </details>
        
          <details>
            <summary>What if I forget my password?</summary>
            <p>
              CroVault uses strong end-to-end encryption. If you lose your password, not even we can access your vault. 
              This is what makes it a true zero-access encrypted storage solution.
            </p>
          </details>
        
          <details>
            <summary>Can I access my vault from another device?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes — your CroVault vault is fully decentralized. With your wallet and password, 
              you can access your encrypted data from any device, anywhere — no server login needed.
            </p>
          </details>
        
          <details>
            <summary>Do you store my data or password?</summary>
            <p>
              No. CroVault never stores your data or password. Everything is encrypted client-side, 
              and your data is saved directly in your blockchain vault. This ensures maximum privacy and zero trust.
            </p>
          </details>
        
          <details>
            <summary>When I try to connect my wallet, nothing happens?</summary>
            <p>
              This is usually a browser or mobile wallet integration issue. Try the following:
              <ul>
                <li>On mobile, try opening the website in the app's integrated browser.</li>
                <li>Make sure your wallet is unlocked and connected to the correct network (Cronos)</li>
                <li>Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)</li>
                <li>Clear your browser cache and cookies</li>
                <li>Disable any ad blockers or privacy extensions that may interfere with wallet connections</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How do I create a vault?</summary>
            <p>
              To create a vault, you need to connect your wallet and set a password. 
              This password will be used to encrypt and decrypt your vault data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you have connected your wallet, you can create a vault by clicking the "Create Vault" button.
              There will be a small fee for creating the vault, which will be displayed in your wallet before you confirm the transaction.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
              <button onclick="showCostModal()" class="btn-custom small maxwidth"><i class="fas fa-coins"></i> View Fees</button>
            </p>
            <p>
              After creating the vault, you can add credentials, notes, and wallet addresses to it.
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How much does it cost to save data?</summary>
            <p>
              When saving data to your vault, two types of payments are involved: a standard transaction fee on the Cronos network, and a small service fee to CroVault.
              When you save data, the fee for saving data will be displayed in your wallet before you confirm the transaction.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
              <button onclick="showCostModal()" class="btn-custom small maxwidth"><i class="fas fa-coins"></i> View Fees</button>
            </p>          
            <p>
              The transaction fee is required for all blockchain operations and is paid in <strong>CRO</strong>, the native token of the Cronos network. 
              This fee varies based on the size of your data and current network congestion. 
              Data storage on a blockchain is expensive, so the fee may be higher than a simple transaction.
              Keep your data small to save on blockchain fees.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the network fee, CroVault charges a small amount of CRO for saving or updating data.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> Reading and deleting data from your vault is always free.
            </p>
          </details>
        
          <details>
            <summary>Why do I need to sign a message?</summary>
            <p>
              Signing a message with your wallet creates a unique key for your session. It enhances security without storing anything sensitive.
            </p>
          </details>
        
          <details>
            <summary>Can I edit or delete data later?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. You can edit or delete saved credentials, notes, or wallet addresses.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How can I store my Authenticator accounts?</summary>
            <p>
              Most popular authenticator apps have no export function, but store the data in the cloud. There is one option for new accounts (or if you re-add accounts):
            </p>
            <p>
              This only works if you still have access to the QR code or manual key when setting up an account in for e.g. Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator or Authy.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When setting up a 2FA account in e.g. Microsoft Authenticator (e.g. for GitHub, Binance, etc.), click “Can’t scan QR code?” or “Use manual entry”
                </li>
                <li>
                  You’ll see a secret key (Base32 string) — looks like:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Copy this key and store it in CroVault under a new “Note”. Example:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Title:</strong> GitHub Authenticator
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Note:</strong><br>
                      Key: JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP<br>
                      Digits: 6<br>
                      Period: 30<br>
                      Algorithm: SHA1
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

            <summary>Is the vault open-source?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. Our vault code is open for review. Transparency is key to trust, and you're encouraged to verify the code yourself.

            <p>
              The website does not use any server-side code. All scripts are run in your browser.
              It is a static website that uses the Cronos EVM blockchain to store your data.
              You can view the source code of the website by right-clicking on the page and selecting "View Page Source".
            </p>
            <p>There are 3 verified smart contracts on the blockchain. You can view the contracts on Cronoscan:</p>
              <ul>

              </ul>
            <p>
              The Vault Contract is the basic contract which is cloned for your own personal vault which stores your data. 
              The Vault Factory is the one that creates your personal vault.
              The Cost Manager is the one that manages the fees for the vault.

            <summary>Why is signing or saving sometimes slow?</summary>
            <p>
              The speed depends on your network connection and the current congestion on Cronos. Wallet popups can also introduce small delays.
