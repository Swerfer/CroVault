    <h1>Seed Phrase Storage: Why “Offline” Isn’t Always Safe</h1>
    <h2>“Just Write It Down” Isn’t Enough Anymore</h2>
    <p>Seed phrases are the keys to your entire crypto identity. If you lose them—or someone else gets access—you lose everything. Most guides say to “write it down and store it offline,” but that advice has limits.</p>
    <p>Paper burns. USB drives fail. Metal plates get stolen. And in most cases, only <strong>you</strong> know where it’s hidden.</p>

    <h2>The Hidden Risks of Offline Storage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single point of failure:</strong> What happens if your only copy is lost?</li>
      <li><strong>No access from anywhere:</strong> Traveling or changing devices? You’re stuck.</li>
      <li><strong>Vulnerable to theft or fire:</strong> Physical storage doesn’t equal perfect security.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In an era of decentralized tools, shouldn’t your backups be decentralized too?</p>

    <h2>How CroVault Solves This</h2>
    <p>CroVault lets you store your seed phrases and private keys encrypted in a vault tied to your crypto wallet. You’re not uploading raw phrases—everything is encrypted client-side.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AES-GCM encryption</li>
      <li>Password + wallet required to unlock</li>
      <li>Stored on Cronos blockchain, not servers</li>
      <li>Nothing readable without your unique key combo</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It’s like having a <strong>fireproof safe</strong> that lives on the blockchain and only opens for you.</p>

    <h2>The Best of Both Worlds</h2>
    <p>You can still store a physical backup if you want—but CroVault gives you a secure, encrypted, <strong>redundant</strong> digital layer.</p>
    <p>Even if your house burns down, your data is safe. All you need is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Your wallet</li>
      <li>Your CroVault password</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Take Control of Your Backups</h2>
    <p>Don’t risk everything on paper. Use CroVault to store seed phrases the modern way—<strong>encrypted, decentralized, and secure</strong>.</p>
