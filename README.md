# 🔐 CroVault

**CroVault** is a decentralized privacy vault DApp that allows users to securely store encrypted credentials, notes, and wallet information on the Cronos blockchain. It uses client-side encryption, self-custody design, and open-source smart contracts to give users full control over their sensitive data — even beyond their lifetime.
