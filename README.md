# CroVault

**CroVault** is a decentralized privacy vault built on the Cronos blockchain. It securely stores encrypted credentials, notes, and wallet information directly on-chain, accessible only through your crypto wallet and a personal password.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**  
  Uses AES-GCM with PBKDF2 for secure, client-side data encryption.

- **Blockchain Storage**  
  Your data is stored in your personal vault smart contract on the Cronos blockchain.

- **Web3-Enabled**  
  No centralized serverâ€”only you control access to your data with your wallet and password.

- **Legacy Support**  
  Optionally share access with trusted individuals when needed.

- **Open Source**  
  All smart contracts are verified and auditable on Cronoscan.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Your Wallet:**  
   Use a Cronos-compatible Web3 wallet to connect to the DApp.

2. **Set a Password:**  
   Create a strong, 12+ character password for client-side encryption (never sent to a server).

3. **Create Your Vault:**  
   Deploy your personal vault smart contract, which stores your encrypted data on the blockchain.

4. **Store and Manage Data:**  
   Add, update, or delete encrypted credentials, notes, and wallet addresses as needed.

5. **Secure Access:**  
   Only someone with both your wallet and your password can decrypt your data.
