# How to Prepare Your Digital Legacy With CroVault

### What Happens to Your Data After You're Gone?

In our digital lives, we collect everything from bank logins and crypto wallets to personal notes and family documents. But what happens to all that data when we’re no longer around?

Unfortunately, the answer for most people is: **no one knows how to access it**.

### The Problem: Lost Data, Frozen Assets, Frustrated Families

Without a clear plan, your family might be locked out of:
- Email and social media accounts
- Cryptocurrency wallets and DeFi platforms
- Notes and password vaults
- Two-factor authentication apps

Even worse, many services require legal paperwork and court orders to access anything—if they allow it at all.

### Enter CroVault: A Secure Digital Vault for Inheritance

CroVault offers a privacy-first, blockchain-secured solution to digital inheritance. Here’s how it works:
- You create a vault tied to your crypto wallet.
- Store encrypted versions of your most important digital credentials and notes.
- Set up optional guidance for loved ones to unlock it, like password hints or estate documents.

Unlike traditional services:
- **No servers.** The data lives on-chain.
- **No bureaucracy.** You define access rules.
- **No recovery requests.** Only your trusted recipients can unlock it.
